Cloudbase Developer's Manual
===============================================================================

///////////////////////////////////////
// PHP Script Format:

Cloudbase is programmed in PHP with the primary pages residing in root Cloudbase
directory. Other PHP scripts are located in the "php" subdirectory. These
scripts are named as follows:
	
	<page where script appears>_<script function>_.php

For example, a script appearing on the "Aircraft" page that displays a table of
aircraft will be named:

	aircraft_create_table.php

The typical scipts found on most pages and their functions are:

	database_access.php //Creates functions for opening and closing database
			    //connections. Found on most pages

	authenticate.php    //Authenticates the user and redirects to the login
			    //page on authentication failure. Found on most
			    //pages

	<page name>_message.php //Checks whether all required fields have been
				//entered and triggers a failure message if
				// a required field has not been entered

	<page name>_update.php  //Adds updates or deletes data from the database
				//related to this page

	<page name>_get_<name>.php //Retrieves data from the database necessary
				   //to populate a table

	<page name>_create_table.php //Creates a table with dynamic data related
				     //to the scripts name

	menu.php	//Contains the main menu

///////////////////////////////////////
// CSS / HTML Styling

All CSS files are located in the "css" folder

The only CSS file that was modified beyond the default bootstrap files is
called:
	
	extrastyle.css

All required CSS and javascript files are included in the script:

	meta_include.php

The file "footer.html" contains all required information to generate the footer
on each page
